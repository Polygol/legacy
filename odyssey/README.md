# Polygol
Ambient OS-like dashboard with clock, weather and advanced features without tracking you or displaying ads.

# Available for GitHub Pages
You can access Polygol right now at https://polygol.github.io/

# Gurapp Applications
Gurapp can extend your Polygol experience. The GitHub repository for each application are seperate from the `polygol.github.io` GitHub repository.

# Running Locally
Applications: You must download the Gurapps from each GitHub repository and place them in the root directory in order for Gurapps to work correctly with Polygol locally.
Assets: You must edit the directory path in the code, since every path assumes that the asset is in root.

# I HATE MISSING ASSETS
If you see images of Fanny BFDI, the assets could not be found. If you are running locally, make sure you have followed the steps.
